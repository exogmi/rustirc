**Files and Changes**:

- **src/commands/handler.rs**:

      - Mode: Handle user and channel modes (e.g., setting channel keys).

  - Implement error handling for cases like missing parameters or invalid commands.

- **src/tests/command_tests.rs**:

    - Use mock clients and shared state to simulate various scenarios.

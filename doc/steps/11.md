### **11. Implement Messaging**

**Feature**: Implement messaging between clients and channels (PRIVMSG, NOTICE).

**Description**:

- Allow clients to send messages to other clients or channels.
- Handle private messages and notices.

**Files and Changes**:

- **src/commands/handler.rs**:

  - Implement handling for PRIVMSG command:

    - Parse the target (user or channel) and the message.
    - If the target is a user:

      - Check if the user exists.
      - Send the message to the target user.

    - If the target is a channel:

      - Check if the channel exists and the client is a member.
      - Broadcast the message to all channel members except the sender.

  - Implement handling for NOTICE command:

    - Similar to PRIVMSG, but typically without generating automated replies.

- **src/models/message.rs**:

  - No major changes unless additional fields are needed.

- **src/tests/command_tests.rs**:

  - Add tests for messaging:

    - Test sending messages to users.
    - Test sending messages to channels.
    - Test error handling when the target does not exist.
    - Test that messages are correctly broadcasted to channel members.

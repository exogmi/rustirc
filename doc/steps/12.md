### **12. Implement Ping/Pong and Aliveness Checking**

**Feature**: Implement server's ability to check if clients are still connected.

**Description**:

- Send PING messages to clients periodically.
- Handle PONG responses to confirm that clients are active.
- Disconnect clients that do not respond within a timeout.

**Files and Changes**:

- **src/server/client.rs**:

  - Add a field to track the last activity timestamp.
  - Implement a method check_aliveness():

    - If the client has been idle for a specified period, send a PING message.
    - If the client does not respond to the PING within a timeout, disconnect the client.

  - Update the client handling loop to periodically call check_aliveness().

- **src/commands/handler.rs**:

  - Implement handling for PING command:

    - Respond with a PONG message.

  - Implement handling for PONG command:

    - Update the client's last activity timestamp.

- **src/tests/client_tests.rs**:

  - Add tests for aliveness checking:

    - Test that PING messages are sent after inactivity.
    - Test that clients respond with PONG.
    - Test that clients are disconnected if they do not respond.

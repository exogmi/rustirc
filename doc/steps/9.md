### **9. Implement Client Registration**

**Feature**: Implement the client registration process (NICK and USER commands).

**Description**:

- Require clients to register a nickname and username before they can interact with the server.
- Validate nicknames and ensure they are unique.
- Send welcome messages upon successful registration.

**Files and Changes**:

- **src/commands/handler.rs**:

  - Implement handling for NICK command:

    - Validate the nickname against allowed patterns.
    - Check if the nickname is already in use.
    - Update the client's nickname in the shared state.

  - Implement handling for USER command:

    - Set the client's username and real name.

  - After both NICK and USER have been received:

    - Mark the client as registered.
    - Send welcome messages (e.g., 001, 002, 003, 004 numerics).

- **src/models/user.rs**:

  - Add nickname validation logic:

    - Define allowed characters and length.
    - Implement a method is_valid_nickname(nickname: &str) -> bool.

- **src/tests/command_tests.rs**:

  - Add tests for client registration:

    - Test successful registration with valid nicknames and usernames.
    - Test handling of duplicate nicknames.
    - Test handling of invalid nicknames.

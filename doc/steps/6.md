### **6. Implement Server Listener**

**Feature**: Implement the server's ability to accept new client connections.

**Description**:

- Listen for incoming TCP connections.
- Accept connections and spawn a new task for each client.
- Manage shared server state accessible to all clients.

**Files and Changes**:

- **src/server/listener.rs**:

  - Implement start_server(address: &str):

    - Bind a TCP listener to the specified address.
    - Accept incoming connections in a loop.
    - For each connection:

      - Assign a unique client ID using utils::generate_client_id().
      - Initialize client state.
      - Clone the shared state for the client task.
      - Spawn a new asynchronous task to handle the client using tokio::spawn.

  - Define SharedState struct or type alias:

    - Contains shared resources like:

      - clients: Concurrent map of client IDs to Client instances.
      - channels: Concurrent map of channel names to Channel instances.

    - Use synchronization primitives like Arc and Mutex or RwLock for thread-safe access.

- **src/tests/server_tests.rs**:

  - Add integration tests for start_server():

    - Test that the server binds to the correct address and port.
    - Test that the server accepts connections from clients.
    - Use mock clients to simulate connections.

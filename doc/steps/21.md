### **21. Implement Logging and Persistence**

**Feature**: Implement logging of messages and persistence of state.

**Description**:

- Save channel topics and keys to files for persistence.
- Log channel messages if required.

**Files and Changes**:

- **src/models/channel.rs**:

  - Implement read_state() and write_state() methods:

    - Save channel topics and keys to a file in a designated state directory.
    - Load the state when the server starts.

- **src/utils.rs**:

  - Implement utility functions for file operations:

    - Functions to read and write state files.
    - Handle file paths and naming to avoid conflicts.

- **src/tests/model_tests.rs**:

  - Add tests for state persistence:

    - Test that channel state is saved correctly.
    - Test that channel state is loaded correctly on server restart.

- **Logging**:

  - Decide whether to implement message logging.

    - If so, update server::client.rs or commands::handler.rs to write messages to log files.

  - Ensure that logging is configurable and does not impact performance.

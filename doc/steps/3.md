### **3. Implement Models**

**Feature**: Implement data models for User, Channel, and Message.

**Description**:

- **User Model**:

  - Represents a connected client.
  - Fields:

    - id: Unique identifier (usize).
    - nickname: Option<String>.
    - username: Option<String>.
    - realname: Option<String>.
    - host: String (client's IP address).
    - channels: HashSet<String> (names of channels the user has joined).
    - status: UserStatus enum.

  - Methods:

    - set_nickname(): Validates and sets the user's nickname.
    - join_channel(): Adds a channel to the user's channel list.
    - leave_channel(): Removes a channel from the user's channel list.

- **Channel Model**:

  - Represents an IRC channel.
  - Fields:

    - name: String.
    - members: HashSet<usize> (IDs of users in the channel).
    - topic: Option<String>.
    - key: Option<String> (channel password).
    - state_path: Option<PathBuf> (for persistence).

  - Methods:

    - add_member(): Adds a user to the channel.
    - remove_member(): Removes a user from the channel.
    - set_topic(): Sets the channel's topic.
    - read_state(): Reads the channel state from disk (if persistence is enabled).
    - write_state(): Writes the channel state to disk.

- **Message Model**:

  - Represents a message sent in the server.
  - Fields:

    - sender_id: usize (ID of the sender).
    - recipient: Recipient enum (User ID or Channel name).
    - content: String.
    - timestamp: DateTime<Utc>.

- **Files and Changes**:

  - **src/models/user.rs**:

    - Define the User struct with the specified fields and methods.
    - Implement validation for nicknames according to IRC standards.
    - Implement the UserStatus enum with variants like Online and Away(Option<String>).

  - **src/models/channel.rs**:

    - Define the Channel struct with the specified fields and methods.
    - Implement methods for adding/removing members and managing the topic.
    - Implement persistence methods (read_state, write_state) if state persistence is required.

  - **src/models/message.rs**:

    - Define the Message struct with the specified fields.
    - Define the Recipient enum with variants User(usize) and Channel(String).

  - **src/tests/model_tests.rs**:

    - Add unit tests for User:

      - Test nickname validation.
      - Test joining and leaving channels.
      - Test status changes (setting away messages).

    - Add unit tests for Channel:

      - Test adding and removing members.
      - Test topic setting and retrieval.
      - Test state persistence methods if applicable.

    - Add unit tests for Message:

      - Test message creation with different recipients.
      - Test timestamp accuracy.

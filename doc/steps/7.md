### **7. Implement Client Handler**

**Feature**: Implement logic for handling individual clients.

**Description**:

- Read and write data to/from the client's socket.
- Parse client input and handle commands.
- Manage per-client state.

**Files and Changes**:

- **src/server/client.rs**:

  - Implement handle_client(socket: TcpStream, shared_state: SharedState):

    - Set up read and write buffers.
    - Loop to read data from the client:

      - Read data from the socket asynchronously.
      - Accumulate data until a complete command is received (commands are typically terminated with \r\n).
      - Parse the command using commands::parser::parse_command().

    - Handle the parsed command:

      - Call commands::handler::handle_command() with the parsed command and client state.

    - Write responses to the client:

      - Send messages back to the client as needed.

    - Handle client disconnection:

      - Break the loop and clean up resources when the client disconnects.

  - Manage per-client state:

    - Fields like id, nickname, username, realname, host, channels, status, etc.

  - Implement methods to send messages to the client.

- **src/tests/client_tests.rs**:

  - Add tests for handle_client():

    - Use mock streams to simulate client input and output.
    - Test handling of various commands.
    - Test proper cleanup on disconnection.
    - Test handling of partial commands and buffer management.
